# Water-Quality-Prediction

## Description

This project presents a detailed machine learning-based analysis of water quality, focusing on predicting the potability of water based on its mineral, bacterial, and viral content. By leveraging a diverse dataset of water sample records, the system explores key chemical and biological indicators that influence water safety. Advanced data preprocessing and modeling techniques are applied to classify whether water is safe for drinking. Achieving a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.079, this model serves as a practical solution for real-world environmental and public health monitoring.

## Features

+ **Machine Learning Models:** Implements and compares multiple models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification and regression tasks.
+ **Prediction Capability:** Provides a binary classification output predicting whether water is Safe or Not Safe for human consumption.
+ **Scalable Design:** Codebase and structure ready for integration into web or mobile apps for real-time water quality monitoring.
+ **Visual Insights:** Interactive plots and feature importance graphs enable a clear understanding of how input features influence safety predictions.
